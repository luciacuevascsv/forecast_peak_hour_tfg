# Hello!

This is the repository for my thesis:

**“Forecast of Daily Consumption Peaks in the Spanish Electrical System”**

In it, you can download a ZIP file containing:

- `data.csv` — the data that is used in all iterations of all my models  
- `hourly.csv` — the data from which the baseline results are computed (they can also be computed from `data.csv`)  
- `results.csv` — the final results set I got from all my iterations  

Moreover, you can also find:

- `applause.wav` — plays at the end of the `code.py` script to notify the end of an iteration  
- `baseline.py` — the code that generates the baseline results  
- `baseline.csv` — the CSV containing the baseline results  
- `code.py` — the main code responsible for running all iterations  
- `graphs.ipynb` — the notebook from which the graphs shown in my thesis are obtained

Thanks for visiting this repository!
